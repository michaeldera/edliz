                It is the national objective that the health care needs of Zimbabweans are met through the provision and
                proper use of essential medicines. Sometimes we do not need to give medicines, that is, there is not
                always a - "pill for every ill". Thus, there is need to use medicines appropriately, efficiently, and
                effectively.

                The guidelines in EDLIZ have always reflected the consensus of local experts, and takes into
                consideration factors such as the Zimbabwean setting, prevailing economic climate, practical experience
                as well as evidence-based therapeutics.

                This new EDLIZ has taken into account the dynamic changes in the Burden of Disease as reflected by the
                inclusion of antiretroviral medicines and treatment of other opportunistic infections other than
                Tuberculosis (TB). Many of the therapeutic regimens of the previous EDLIZ still hold true and remain the
                same, and should reinforce the confidence of the prescriber in making reliable therapeutic choices.
            </p>
            <p>
                I urge all health workers to familiarise themselves with the revised guidelines, to prescribe within the
                bounds of this publication, and to recognise the critical importance of providing a quality service to
                all health care recipients through the rational use of medicines.

                EDLIZ <strong>REMAINS</strong> good medicine! Use it.
