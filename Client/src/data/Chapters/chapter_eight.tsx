                    <p>
                        ART should be provided to all people with confirmed HIV diagnosis and with a CD4 count of ≤
                        500cels /mm3.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <strong>As a priority</strong>, initiate ART in all individuals with severe/advanced HIV disease
                        (WHO clinical stage 3 or 4) or CD4 count less or equal to 350 cells/ mm <sup>3</sup>. It is also
                        recommended to initiate ART in the following categories of patients regardless of CD4 cell
                        count:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Active TB disease</li>
                        <li>Pregnant and breast-feeding women with HIV</li>
                        <li>Individuals with HIV in sero-discordant relationships</li>
                        <li>HBV co-infection with severe chronic liver disease</li>

                        <strong>Patients with CD4 &lt;100 </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Patients with low CD4 below 100 should be fast-tracked for treatment initiation. They should be
                        screened for symptomatic TB and cryptococcal disease. They should receive Cotrimoxazole and INH
                        prophylaxis like all other patients and should be closely monitored for 3 months as this is
                        their highest risk period for bacterial infections and TB or cryptococcal IRIS. Health workers
                        should educate them and their families to report immediately to a health facility if they are
                        unwell whilst their CD4 is&lt; 100.

                    <h3>Adherence to ART</h3>
                    <p>
                        WHO defines treatment adherence as ‘the extent to which a person’s behaviour- taking
                        medications, following a diet and/or executes lifestyle changes’ corresponds with agreed
                        recommendations from a health care provider.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Efforts to support adherence should start before ART initiation and should include basic
                        information about HIV, the ARV medicines, expected adverse events, preparations for long-term
                        ART. Effective adherence support interventions include client-centred behavioural counselling
                        and support, support from peer educators trained as “expert patients,” community treatment
                        supporters and mobile text messaging. Other interventions involve encouraging people to disclose
                        their HIV status and providing them with adherence tools such as pill boxes, diaries, and
                        patient reminder aids. During follow-up, patients should be assessed for adherence to whatever
                        treatment plan has been agreed upon (Integrated HIV training curriculum,MoHCC).

                    <p>
                        The choice of medicine regimen is based on the “essential medicine” concept and the rational use
                        of medicine. To maximise adherence, use of FDC medicines is strongly encouraged.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A large number of medicines and medicine combinations have been used in the treatment of persons
                        with HIV infection. The choice of ARVs has been based on evidence of efficacy and safety, on
                        availability and cost of medications, as well as on the side effects profile and the potential
                        for development of resistance. The national ART programme will use the following FDCs in the
                        first line regimens:
                    </p>
                    <p>Dual combinations:</p>

                            tenofovir (TDF) 300mg + lamivudine (3TC) 300mg zidovudine (AZT) 300mg + lamivudine (3TC)
                            150mg
                        </li>
                        <li>The above dual FDC should be used in combination with single formulation of:</li>
                        <li>Efavirenz (EFV) 600mg once daily</li>
                        <li>(NVP) 200mg twice a day (after the 2 weeks of once a day nevirapine) </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Triple combinations:</p>

                        Tenofovir (TDF) plus Lamivudine (3TC) plus Efavirenz (EFV) is the preferred first-line regimen,
                        which obviously would necessitate a change in the currently used second-line regimens.

                        specialist in HIV and AIDS treatment or the clinical mentorship team at the OI/ART clinic, as

                        TB is the most common OI encountered among people with HIV infection in Zimbabwe. Since the
                        advent of the pandemic of HIV infection, TB has remained a serious public-health problem.
                        Studies have shown that up to 50% of people with HIV infection develop TB and that up to 85% of
                        patients with TB have HIV infection. In addition, TB accounts for a third of HIV-related deaths.
                        There is a need to integrate the HIV and TB services, as TB and HIV coinfection is common.

                        In patients who have HIV-related TB but are not yet on ART, treatment of TB takes priority. ART
                        should be started at least two weeks after the start of TB therapy i.e. during the intensive
                        phase when the patient has stabilised on TB treatment regardless of their CD4 count status.
                        TB/HIV co-infected patients with severe immunosuppression such as CD4 count less than 50
                        cells/mm3, should receive ART early i.e. within the first 2 weeks of initiating TB treatment.
                        Cotrimoxazole prophylaxis should be provided with the commencement of the TB therapy if the
                        patient is not on it already.

                        All patients initiating ART should be clinically screened for evidence of symptomatic
                        cryptococcal disease – headache, neck stiffness, fever, focal neurologic signs, confusion, and
                        altered mental status. All those who screen positive should be referred for further diagnostic
                        work up for meningitis. Screening of asymptomatic ART naïve individuals with CD4 count
                        &lt;100cells/mm3 is recommended and should be done with a Cryptococcal neoformans antigen test
                        (CrAg) using latex agglutination tests (LA) or lateral flow assays (LFA) on serum, plasma or
                        CSF. A lumbar puncture should be offered to individuals who screen positive for cryptococcal
                        antigen, as a positive cryptococcal antigen may precede the onset of clinical cryptococcal
                        meningitis by many weeks.

                        weeks after initiation of antifungal therapy with amphotericin B based regimens. In patients who
                        are predominately treated with fluconazole monotherapy ART should be initiated at least 4 weeks
                        after initiation of antifungal therapy.

                        More than 90% of HIV-infected children acquire their infection through mother to child

                            Thus, elimination of new HIV infections among children through effective PMTCT interventions
                            should be prioritized
                        </strong>
                        . HIV disease progression occurs very rapidly in the first few months of life in infants
                        acquiring HIV in utero, often leading to death. The importance of early infant diagnosis (EID)
                        of HIV infection and early initiation of ART can therefore not be overemphasised.

                        All infants should have their HIV-exposure status established at their first contact with the
                        health system, ideally before six weeks of age. Check for HIV exposure status on the child
                        health card, or inquire from the mother or caregiver. Where the mother is available and was not
                        tested during pregnancy, perform a rapid HIV test on the mother and if she is positive, then her
                        infant is HIV exposed and needs to have a DBS collected for HIV DNA PCR.

                        At 9 months of age, most infants (93%) no longer possess maternally transferred antibodies.
                        Prior to the age of 18 months, a DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for HIV is more
                        reliable. A DNA PCR test should be offered to all exposed infants from six weeks of age. If the
                        DNA PCR test is negative before the age of 18 months, the infant does not have HIV infection but
                        is at risk of infection if breastfeeding is continued.

                    <p>
                        Antibody tests DCPtrial and laboratory-based ELISA) are the preferred method of diagnosis for
                        HIV infection for children over 18 months of age.

                    <p>
                        In a child under 18 months who has not breastfed for more than six weeks, HIV antibody tests
                        that are <em>negative</em> mean the child is uninfected.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        HIV antibody tests that are <em>positive</em> at any age under 18 months identify those infants
                        who need virological tests (i.e., the child is HIV exposed but needs definitive test with HIV
                        DNA PCR to confirm HIV infection).

            <h3>General Notes</h3>
            <p>
                Appropriate and effective provision of ARVs needs to be provided by those who have received standardised
                training in the management of opportunistic infections as well as in the use of antiretroviral
                medicines. For more details on the use of ARVs refer to the current{' '}
                <strong>
                    <em>Antiretroviral Therapy for the Prevention and Treatment of HIV in Zimbabwe.</em>
                </strong>{' '}
                Attempts should be made to train healthcare workers in HIV management
            </p>
            <p>
                Comprehensive DCPTRIAL care requires that there be provision of counselling; either VCT or PITC,
                laboratory capacity for baseline assessment and monitoring as well as to diagnose commonly encountered
                opportunistic infections such as TB and cryptococcal meningitis. Pharmacy personnel should also be
                trained in OI/ART management as they will be required to ensure rational prescribing and proper
                dispensing of the antiretroviral medicines. In addition, they will also be required to ensure that their
                hospital/clinic has adequate ARV medicine supplies.

                <strong>Goals of ART</strong>
            </p>
            <p>The aims of antiretroviral therapy (ART) are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Maximal and durable suppression of replication of HIV,</li>
                <li>Restoration and/or preservation of immune function,</li>
                <li>Reduction of HIV-related morbidity and mortality,</li>
                <li>Improvement of quality of life.</li>
                <li>Prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (vertical transmission), and</li>
                <li>
                    Reduction of transmission of HIV from infected to uninfected individuals through use of ARVs by the
                    infected individual now commonly known as ‘Treatment as prevention’.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                <strong>Criteria for initiating ART in and adults </strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                Prior to starting ART, patients should be assessed for readiness to take ARVs; the ARV regimen; dosage
                and scheduling; the likely potential adverse effects; and the required monitoring. Both medical and
                psychosocial issues need to be addressed before initiating ART. Patients should be adequately counseled
                about adopting appropriate life style measures such as safer sexual practices (including appropriate use
                of condoms), and any other psychosocial problems that may interfere with adherence (e.g., alcohol,
                psychiatric disorders) should be addressed. At each clinic visit always screen for tuberculosis using a
                TB symptom checklist, advise patients about adequate nutrition and the importance of medicine adherence
                and regular follow up care. People taking ARVs should also be regularly asked on whether they are taking
                other medicines including herbal remedies that may interfere with the efficacy of ARVs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Early treatment initiation is associated with clinical and HIV prevention benefits, improving survival
                and reducing the incidence of HIV infection at the community level. Increasing evidence also indicate
                that untreated HIV may be associated with the development of severe non-AIDS defining conditions
                including cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, liver disease and neurocognitive disorders. Recent
                results from the HPTN 052 Study strongly support the use of ART to prevent HIV transmission among
                sero-discordant couples.
