        <h1>Immunisation</h1>
        <h2>General Notes</h2>
        <p><small>The terms immunisation and vaccination will be used interchangeably in this chapter. Further information on immunisation, the cold chain etc, may be found in the <strong>Manual for the Zimbabwe Expanded Programme on Immunisation (ZEPI)</strong>. Information relating to rabies can be found in the chapter on tropical diseases. </small></p>
        <h3>Adverse events</h3>
        <ul><li>All adverse events following immunisation should be reported using the <em>'Adverse Events Following Immunisation' (AEFI)</em> form. Health workers should refer to the ZEPI AEFI guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures.</li></ul>
        <h3> Diseases Preventable by Immunisation</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Diphtheria</li>
          <li>Measles</li>
          <li>Rubella</li>
          <li>Hepatitis B</li>
          <li>Pertussis (whooping cough)</li>
          <li>Poliomyelitis</li> <li>Rabies</li>
          <li>Tetanus</li>
          <li>Tuberculosis</li>
          <li>Some pneumonias, septicaemia and meningitis (caused by Haemophilus Influenza type B and Streptococcus pneumoniae)</li>
          <li>Diarrhoea, vomiting and systematic upset due to Rotavirus infection.</li>
          <li>Cancer caused by Human Papilloma Virus infection.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Open vial policy</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Open vials of DPT, DPT-HepB-Hib (Pentavalent), DT, TT, OPV, HPV and HepB may be used in subsequent sessions for a maximum of 28 days (ZEPI Policy) provided the vaccine has not expired, the VVM has not reached the discard point, the vial has not been contaminated, the vaccine has been kept in appropriate cold chain condition. </li>
          <li>. Reconstituted vials of measles, BCG <strong>and HPV </strong>vaccines must be discarded as per manufacturer‘s instructions or at the end of the session whichever comes first</li>
        </ul>
        <h3> Effectiveness of Vaccines in HIV Infected Individuals</h3>
        <p>EPI recommended vaccines have shown satisfactory seroconversion rates in early stages of HIV infection.  However the proportion of responders decreases with progression from HIV infection to AIDS.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Children with known or asymptomatic HIV infection should receive all EPI vaccines according to the schedule.</li>
          <li> BCG vaccine should not be given to children with clinical symptoms of HIV infection.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Immunisation Schedule for Children</h2>
        <p>See Table 3.1. This schedule is the only schedule to be used in Zimbabwe. Ages given are minimum ages for each vaccination. Children should receive doses at these stated ages or at the first contact after reaching that age (maximum age limits are: BCG 11 months, Rotavirus 32 weeks, and Pentavalent 23 months).</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Always check the dosage instructions in the manufacturer‘s information supplied with the vaccine, as the strength may vary between manufacturers.</li>
          <li> Always remember to record the batch number of the vaccine on the child‘s health card when entering the date of immunisation.</li>
          <li> Always ensure that the emergency box is available and is stocked with appropriate emergency medicines.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Integrating Routine Immunization with other Interventions</h3>
        <p>A strategy commonly known as <em>EPI plus</em> provides a platform for delivery of other health interventions such as Vitamin A supplementation, deworming, distribution of Insecticide Treated Nets for malaria prevention and early infant diagnosis (DBS) of HIV infection.  Currently ZEPI has integrated vitamin A supplementation into the routine EPI program. Any immunization contact is an opportunity to screen mothers and infants for eligibility to receive Vitamin A.</p>

        <h2>Tetanus Immunisations for Adults</h2>
        <p>An adult woman with a complete course of childhood immunisations including boosters should need<strong> only</strong> one booster dose of tetanus toxoid vaccine, (recommended at first pregnancy) which should protect for life.</p>

        <p>NB: WHO has recommended that countries switch from TT to Td, however Zimbabwe has not adopted this policy yet</p>
        <h3>Immunisation details for available vaccines</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Always check the dosage instructions in the manufacturer‘s information supplied with the vaccine as strengths may vary.</li>
          <li>In the event of a measles epidemic, children between 6 and 9 months can be vaccinated. However the measles vaccination must be repeated again after 9 months and another dose at 18 months.</li>
          <li>The minimum interval for HB2 and HB3 is 5 months, if given as a mono dose</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Contraindications to Vaccines</h2>
        <p>There are very few absolute contraindications to vaccines.  . Fever, diarrhoea, mild respiratory infection and malnutrition are not contraindications to vaccines.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>BCG vaccine should not be given to a child with symptomatic HIV infection but polio and measles/rubella vaccines should be given to children with HIV and AIDS together with other vaccines.</li>
          <li> A second or third dose of Pentavalent and DTP at 18 months should not be given to a child who severely reacted to a previous dose of Pentavalent (Note DTP because of the whole cell Pertussis may cause severe anaphylaxis, collapse, or convulsions). DT should be given instead. .</li>
          <li> A child with an evolving neurological disease such as uncontrolled epilepsy or progressive encephalopathy should not be given Pentavalent or DTP. Give DT instead. NB: The current DPT contains whole cell pertussis.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Interval between multi-doses of the same antigen </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>The minimum interval between doses is 28 days.</li>
          <li> If any dose of an antigen for subsequent doses is delayed,vaccinations on the next attendance should be continued as if the usual interval had elapsed (i.e. 4 weeks have elapsed).   All the EPI antigens are safe and effective when administered simultaneously i.e. during the same vaccination session but on different sites.  Pentavalent, Pneumococcal, Rotavirus, IPV and OPV are given simultaneously.</li>
          <li> If a vaccine dose is given at less than the recommended 28 days interval, it should not be counted as a valid dose and therefore should be repeated at the appropriate interval of 28 days from the previous dose. This applies to vaccines given during campaigns such as child health days, national immunisation days or in reaction to outbreaks of vaccine preventable diseases.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Hospital Admission Policy on Immunisation </h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To reduce nosocomial transmission, Measles vaccine should be given on admission to all children six months to 15 years. This admission dose must be recorded on the graph side of the child health card corresponding with the age at which it was given and written vertically. If the child is 9 months and receives the first dose on admission this is charted on the appropriate section of the card.</li>
          <li> Health workers should ascertain the vaccination status for all admitted children including those without a child health card and give the appropriate antigens. </li>
          <li> Children who are very ill on admission should be vaccinated as soon as their condition has improved.</li>
        </ul>
