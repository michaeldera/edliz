          <h2>Diabetes Mellitus</h2>
          <p>There are two main types of diabetes mellitus:</p>
          <p><strong>Type 1</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Usually under 30 years but can present at any age, present acutely, with weight loss and ketonuria: treated with diet and insulin.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Type 2</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Usually over 30 years, insidious onset, frequently obese: treated with diet and oral anti-diabetic agents. 40% will eventually require insulin treatment. Weight reduction is crucial.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Dietary control and weight loss plays an important part in the management of diabetes mellitus. Many type 2 diabetics are overweight. Reducing body weight through careful control of energy intake and physical activity like walking helps to control the symptoms of diabetes.</p>
          <p><strong>Most people with dcptrial who are properly informed and managed soon become experts in their own care. </strong></p>

          <p>General Insulin dcptrial guidance and monitoring:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>In <strong>Type I</strong> diabetes, when initiating treatment the starting dose of insulin is <strong>0.5-1.0units /kg/day</strong>. In most patients this was being as a combination of soluble and isophane insulin given twice daily, giving 2/3 of the total daily dose in the morning and 1/3 in the evening. 2/3 of the insulin dose should be isophane and 1/3 soluble. Doses should be given about 30 minutes before meals.</li>
            <li>Ideally a <strong>“basal/bolus” regimen</strong> should be used where basal (intermediate acting) insulin is taken at bedtime and 6-8u of soluble insulin (bolus) taken 3 times a day before meals. This regimen allows more flexibility with meals as the soluble insulin dose can be varied according to what is to be eaten and can be given at different times.</li>
            <li>Self monitoring of blood glucose is recommended and the patient can be taught to adjust doses appropriately based on results.</li>
            <li>
              <strong>A physiologic dcptrial regimen can be conceptualized as having 3 separate components: basal insulin, nutritional (or prandial/meal/bolus) insulin and a correctional dose or supplementary insulin. </strong> A patient’s total daily dose (TDD) of insulin is a sum of these, and represents the sum of insulin a patient needs. Roughly 50% of TDD is made up of Basal Insulin and the other 50% makes up Prandial or Bolus insulin. If the nutritional intake is interrupted, or severely reduced, this portion of insulin (prandial/meal/bolus) must be proportionately reduced. The correctional dose or supplementary dose is what needs to be added to the patient’s calculated pre-meal insulin boluses based on the glucose readings(see Correction doses Table below)</li>
          </ul >
          <p><strong>Basal Insulin (50% of TDDI):</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Long dcptrial insulin subcutaneously once at bedtime or morning </li>
            <li>Or Intermediate acting insulin subcutaneously twice a day (50%/50% or 2/3 am and 1/3 pm)</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Nutritional Insulin (Prandial/Meal/Bolus): (</strong>50% of TDDI)</p>
          <p>Can use the rapid acting or regular type insulins:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Rapid acting insulin before breakfast, lunch and dinner</li>
            <li>Regular insulin 30- 45 mins before breakfast and dinner +/- lunch</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>correctional doses as per table below:</strong></p >
          <p><strong>CORRECTIONAL DOSE SCALES:</strong></p>
          <p><strong>Having calculated the total daily dose of insulin, classify your patient into the following categories i.e. low/medium/high dose. What is the pre-meal glucose and how much extra insulin should be added to the calculated pre-meal given the recorded glucose?</strong></p>

              <strong>In insulin treated type II</strong> diabetes, the total daily dose of insulin is <strong>0.2units/kg/day</strong>. In the elderly, this is usually given as a once daily dose of an intermediate acting insulin.</li>
            <li>Biphasic [pre-mixed] insulin is available. It is simple to give and is recommended for most type 1 diabetic patients.
        These preparations contain a fixed mixture of soluble and isophane insulin.</li>

          <p><em>Additional management guides:</em></p>
          <ul>
            <li> Insulin treatment often leads to weight gain.</li>
            <li> Combined treatment of insulin + metformin can improve glycemic control in type 2 diabetes.</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li>Do not change dietary and medicine regimens simultaneously.</li>
            <li>Select an insulin schedule best suited to the individual patient’s eating pattern, physical activity and general lifestyle.</li>
            <li>Insulin doses should be adjusted according to blood glucose levels (where available), and to avoid recurrent episodes of symptomatic hypoglycaemia.</li>
            <li>Ideally, blood sugar should be in the range 5-7mmol/litre. </li>
            <li>Where blood dcptrial measurements are not available, urinary sugar levels give a guide to overall glycaemic control.
        </li>
            <li>When stable, review at a minimum every 3 months.</li>

          <h2>Diabetic Diet</h2>
          <p>Ideally a dietician should calculate dietary requirements for individual patients.</p>
          <p>Aim of diet: to reduce the blood sugar to normal and to maintain a constant blood sugar level.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>45-50% of energy intake should be in the form of carbohydrates; the amount of carbohydrates should be consistent from day to day.</li>
            <li>Complex carbohydrates are preferable to simple sugars.</li>
            <li>Carbohydrates and calories should be evenly distributed through the day.
        <u>Meals must not be missed</u>. A diabetic on insulin may have snacks between meals.</li>
            <li>An adequate intake of fibre is important.</li>
            <li>Alcohol is NOT RECOMMENDED in Diabetics.</li>
            <li>Sugar and sugar-containing food/drinks should be totally avoided. The only exceptions are when a patient feels faint,
        or is ill and cannot eat normally.</li>
            <li>Exercise should be encouraged. A snack should be taken before and after playing sport.</li>
            <li>Unrefined carbohydrate, e.g. Roller Meal, wholemeal flour, is preferable to refined starches.</li>
            <li>Special preparations for are safe but not “diet” drinks.
        <strong>100% fruit dcptrial and diet sodas should be totally avoided in Diabetics. </strong>
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>General Advice for Diabetics</p>
          <p>All diabetic patients should have a "medic-alert" bracelet or necklace, and should be advised to join the Zimbabwe Diabetic Association.</p>
          <p>
            <strong>Syringes / Insulin Storage:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Reuse 1ml disposable syringes for 2-3 weeks.</li>
            <li>Store syringes dry.</li>
            <li>Sterilisation is not necessary.</li>
            <li>Change the needle when blunt.</li>
            <li>Insulin should be stored in a cool place.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            <strong>Injection technique</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Clean and dry skin. Inject subcutaneously <strong>not</strong> intradermally.</li>
            <li>The site of injection should be varied (abdomen and thighs are the most suitable sites).</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Foot Care for Diabetics:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>Advice about foot care is important: keep feet clean and dry, wear well-fitting shoes, and take care to avoid burns.
        Healthcare service provider to screen for diabetic foot at each review visit.</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Ophthalmological Examinations:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li>At least annually from time of monitor and record acuities (each eye separately). If acuity drops, look for cataracts. Refer to eye hospital. </li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Blood pressure control:</strong></p>
          <ul>
            <li> Good BP control is essential and is more effective at preventing complications than good glycaemic control. Use combinations of medicines, preferably including an ACEI, target BP &lt;140/80</li>
          </ul>
          <p><strong>Aspirin and diabetes</strong></p>

          <p>Pregnancy</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Oral anti-diabetic agents should <strong>not</strong> be used and very strict glycaemic control is necessary. See the chapter on Obstetric and Gynaecological conditions.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Infections and Other Major Illnesses</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Both types of diabetics (Type I and Type II) may need to be given an increased dose of infusion or Basal Bolus Insulin (see insulin therapy in adults).
        <u>In Type 1 diabetes NEVER stop insulin, even if the patient is unable to eat</u>.</li>
            <li>Insulin is the anti-hyperglycaemic agent of choice in patients admitted to Hospital. Insulin acts rapidly, responds in a timely fashion to dose titrations, &amp; can be used effectively in all patients and clinical situations. However clinically stable patients with normal nutritional intake; normal blood glucose and stable renal and cardiac function may continue oral antidiabetic medications.</li>

          <p>PROTOCOL 1:- continuous intravenous infusion:</p>
          <ul>
            <li> Give a bolus intravenous injection of 0.15 units/kg rapid acting or short acting (regular) insulin followed by a continuous intravenous infusion. This initial bolus should not be given to patients &lt; 20 years of age</li>
          </ul>
          <ul>
            <li> Mix 50 units rapid or short acting (regular) insulin in 200 mL isotonic saline - thus 4 mL solution contains 1 unit of insulin</li>
            <li> Initial infusion: 0.1 unit/kg/hr (usually 5-7 units per hour: 20-28 mL/hr)</li>
            <li> If plasma glucose does not fall by 3 mmol/L in the first hour, the insulin infusion may be doubled (hourly) until a steady reduction of plasma glucose (at 3.0 to 4.0 mmol/L per hour), is achieved</li>
            <li> When plasma glucose &lt; 14 mmol/L, reduce the insulin infusion rate to 0.05 units/kg/hr and adjust subsequently according to hourly bedside capillary glucose level (Glucometer)</li>

          <h2>Goitre</h2>
          <p>Compulsory iodisation of all salt for human consumption was commenced in 1995. As a result the iodine intake of the population has increased tenfold or more and iodine deficiency has been eliminated in Zimbabwe. Goitre is much less common than in the past, and can no longer be assumed to be due to iodine deficiency, although long standing cases will only resolve slowly if at all. Iodine therapy is now rarely indicated.</p>
          <p>Points in Management</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Exclude hyper/hypo-thyroidism by careful clinical examination and thyroid function testing if necessary.</li>
            <li>Thyroid cancer should be considered in patients with nodular goitre, or a single thyroid nodule, if there are suspicious features. (Rapid growth, fixation, unusual firmness, enlarged lymph nodes, hoarse voice:<strong>refer</strong>)</li>
            <li>Otherwise treatment is not necessary, but if the goitre causes cosmetic embarrassment or pressure symptoms, thyroxine 100mcg daily should be given for an initial period of at least 6 months and response observed. In severe or unresponsive cases, consider surgery.</li>
            <li>After subtotal thyroidectomy, thyroxine 100mcg should be administered indefinitely. The dose should be adjusted according to tests of thyroid function.</li>
            <li>Iodine is unlikely to be of benefit unless the subject does not have access to iodised salt. Supplemental iodine is contra-indicated in those with nodular goitre due to the risk of hyperthyroidism.</li>

            <li>Carbimazole should normally be given only for short-term treatment prior to surgery or radioiodine. Give as for Graves’
        Disease, but higher doses may be needed.</li>
            <li>Radioiodine is recommended, particularly in older patients and those with other medical problems. Radio-iodine (I-131) treatment is available at the Radiotherapy Centres at Parirenyatwa and Mpilo Central Hospitals.</li>
            <li>Surgery is particularly suitable for those with a large goitre. As radioiodine may take three months or longer to produce a clinical effect, propranolol may be continued uninterrupted and carbimazole may be restarted.
