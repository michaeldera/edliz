        <h3><a><br /> General Notes</a>
        </h3>
        <p>Mother-to-child transmission is responsible for more than 90% of HIV infection in children and at least two thirds of such infections occur during pregnancy and delivery whilst the remainder occur during breastfeeding. It is therefore critical to identify HIV-positive pregnant and lactating women and manage them appropriately.</p>
        <p><strong>When to start ART in HIV positive pregnant and breastfeeding women</strong>
          <br /></p>
        <ul>
          <li>All HIV infected pregnant and breastfeeding women should initiate lifelong antiretroviral treatment (ART) irrespective of their CD4 count or WHO clinical stage (Option B+).</li>
          <li>Women who are not yet ready for lifelong ART should be initiated on triple ARVs (ART), which should be continued at least for the duration of breastfeeding to prevent further risk of mother-to-child transmission of HIV through breast milk.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
          <li>HIV infected lactating women meeting treatment eligibility criteria (CD4 500 or less) should continue lifelong ART according to criteria for adult non-pregnant populations as it would be inappropriate for them to discontinue ART after the breastfeeding period <strong>.</strong>
          </li>
        </ul >
        <p>N.B. Pregnant and breastfeeding women who were initiated on Zidovudine prophylaxis should be discontinued and commenced on lifelong ART (Option B+).</p >
        <p><strong>Being on lifelong ART will necessitate ongoing counselling of HIV positive pregnant and breastfeeding women to support retention and adherence and to minimize loss to follow-up.</strong></p >
        <ul>
          <li>Emphasise modes of HIV transmission and prevention, PMTCT, and access to care and treatment.</li>
          <li>Encourage partner HIV testing and counselling</li>
          <li>the importance of skilled birth attendance, clean and safe delivery, and newborn care. </li>
          <li>Counsel on infant and young child feeding and maternal nutrition.</li>
          <li>Counsel on sexual and reproductive health including family planning and the need for dual contraception (reliable hormonal contraceptive plus barrier method like male or female condoms)</li>
          <li>Make an appointment for family planning at six weeks postpartum.</li>
          <li>Stress the need for condom use for prevention of STIs and HIV during pregnancy and in the postpartum period.</li>
          <li>Retest previously negative women in 3 <sup>rd</sup> trimester of pregnancy and/ or at delivery, 6 weeks post natally and 6 monthly thereafter.</li>
          <li>
            Stress the importance of follow-up for the HIV exposed infant <ul>
              <li>Commence cotrimoxazole prophylaxis from 6 weeks of age</li>
              <li>Collect Dried Blood Spot (DBS) for HIV DNA PCR test at 6 weeks of age i.e.Early Infant Diagnosis (EID).</li>
              <li>Infants should be re-tested at the end of the breast-feeding period</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>When using ARVs in pregnant women, certain precautions should be kept in mind:</p >
        <p><strong>Efavirenz (EFV)</strong></p>
        <p>Previously there was a recommendation <strong>not</strong> to use Efavirenz during the first and in women at risk of becoming pregnant. However, WHO issued evidence based update on Efavirenz safety in pregnancy in 2011 which recommends it to be safe for use even in the first trimester.</p>
        <h3><a>Infant and young child feeding recommendations</a>
        </h3>
        <p>All mothers whether known to be infected with HIV or not should exclusively breastfeed their infants (no mixed feeding)
          for the first 6 months of life, introducing safe, adequate and nutritious complementary foods thereafter, with continued breastfeeding up to 24 months and beyond.</p>
        <p><strong>ARV prophylaxis in an infant </strong></p>
        <p>HIV-exposed infants whose mothers are on lifelong ART should be commenced on Nevirapine prophylaxis for six weeks.</p>

        </table >
        <ul>
          <li>Always dcptrial to change the dose when baby gains weight. </li>
          <li>*For very low birth weight babies below 2000g dose of NVP is 2 mg/kg once daily for 6 weeks</li>
          <li>If any contraindications to NVP use 3TC 4mg per kg 12hourly for 6 weeks</li>
          <li>For non-breastfeeding infants NVP as above or AZT 4mg/kg 12 hourly for 6 weeks</li>
        </ul>
