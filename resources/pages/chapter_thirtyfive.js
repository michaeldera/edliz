        <h1>Reporting Adverse Medicine Reactions</h1>
        <p>Since the thalidomide disaster, voluntary reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) has become important in monitoring the safety of medicines. ADR reporting can also help to identify irrational presenting, bad batches of a medicine and problems specific to particular patient groups.</p>
        <p>For the purpose of reporting an adverse drug reaction (ADR), a medicine is defined as:</p>
        <p><em>Any substance administered to man for the prophylaxis, diagnosis or therapy of disease, or the modification of physiological function</em></p>
        <p><strong>An adverse reaction to a medicine is defined as: </strong></p>
        <p><em>A reaction which is noxious and unintended, and which occurs at doses normally used in humans for the prophylaxis, diagnosis, or therapy of disease, or for the modification of physiological function. </em></p>
        <p>This includes herbal and traditional medicines</p>
        <p>All <strong>suspected</strong> adverse reactions are of interest, ranging from wellknown 'side effects' to <strong>dangerous and serious</strong> reactions</p>
        <p>Examples include anaphylaxis to penicillin, Steven- Johnson syndrome in HIV patients given cotrimoxazole, itching due to chloroquine, etc.  Reactions to vaccines specially imported unregistered medicines, congenital abnormalities and lack of therapeutic effect should also be reported.</p>
        <p>Suspected ADRâ€˜s should be reported on the standard form</p>
        <p>Forms can be obtained from the Medicines Control Authority of Zimbabwe, 106 Baines Avenue, Harare, Tel +263-4708255/2901327-317, Fax +263-4-736980, E-mail: <a href="mailto:mcaz@mcaz.co.zw">mcaz@mcaz.co.zw</a></p>
