        <h1>Haematology and Blood Products</h1>
        <h2>Anaemia</h2>
        <p>This is defined as a decrease in the concentration of haemoglobin (less than 13.5 g/dl in men and less than 11.5 g /dl in women) and haematocrit (less than 0.42 in men and less than 0.36 in women). Use of red blood cell indices and careful examination of a peripheral blood smear may indicate the likely cause of anaemia. If in doubt contact a central hospital laboratory for assistance (peripheral blood films and where possible bone marrow films can be sent for comment).</p>
        <p><em> Avoid blood transfusion before knowing the cause of anaemia or at least taking samples for doing appropriate investigations. Further, avoid transfusions in cases correctacble by hematinics or other therapy, unless patient has life threatening symptoms.  Avoid polypharmacy (giving multiple haematinics without knowing the cause of the anaemia).</em></p>
        <h3>Iron deficiency anaemia</h3>
        <p><em> Note: parenteral iron, which is neither faster acting nor more effective than oral iron, is rarely indicated. The cause of Iron deficiency anaemia must be elucidated as much as possibleas correcting the primary cause should be the most single important objective.  The typical blood picture is that of hypochromia microcytosi (MCV less than 75fL).</em></p>

          <tr><td colSpan="5">Paed = 12mg, less than 1yr = 6mg iron</td></tr>
        </table>
        <p>Expected response rise is haemoglobin 1g/dl/week. Continue treatment for 3 months after haemoglobin has normalised to replenish body iron stores.</p>
        <h3>Megaloblastic Anaemia</h3>
        <p>This is due to deficiency of vitamin B12 and/or folic acid.  It is important to establish the cause of the deficiency for appropriate treatment. The typical blood picture is that of macrocytosis with or without reduced platelet count (MCV >105 fL). Until or unless blood levels are available, it is <u>mandatory</u> to give both vitamin B12 (parenteral) and folic acid to prevent precipitation of neuropathy.</p>
        <p><em>Avoid blood transfusion if possible</em></p>
        <p>Macrocytosis also occurs in liver disease, alcohol excess, hypothyroidism, some haemolytic anaemias and myelodysplastic syndromes. In the presence of these conditions vitamin B12 /folate deficiency must be excluded. Macrocytosis is physiological in the neonate.</p>
        <h4>Vitamin B<sub>12</sub> Deficiency</h4>
        <p>Lifelong replacement is mandatory in pernicious anaemia, postgastrectomy or illeal resection.</p>

        </table>
        <p>In <strong>painful crisis,</strong> intravenous rehydration, regular and adequate analgesia, oxygen by mask where available and possibly in some cases antibiotics are required.</p>
        <p>Morphine is necessary to control <strong>severe pain</strong>. Weaker opiates (codeine) or non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medicines (e.g. aspirin) may be used for less severe pain. See chapter on Pain.</p>
        <h4>Antibiotic theraphy</h4>

        <h4>Osteomyelitis</h4>
        <p>see chapter on Bone and Joint Conditions.</p>
        <h4>Other types of crises</h4>
        <p>In aplastic and haemolytic crisis, red cell transfusion may be required to treat anaemic heart failure. Sequestration or splenic pooling requires splenic massage and less often, blood transfusion. Note that over transfusion worsens the sickling crisis and may cause iron overload. Special precautions must be taken during anaesthetizing sickle cell disease patients. Adequate hydration and oxygen exposure are essential to avoid red cell sickling.</p>
        <p>Avoid debridement of leg ulcers as these are due poor circulation rather than mere dead tissue.</p>
        <p>Treat priapism conservatively with hydration and analgesia before resorting to surgery.</p>
        <p>Patients with frequent crises need to be started on hydroxy urea where possible, refer to provincial central hospital. The objective is to increase the HbF to at least 20%, levels which do not lead to haemolysis.</p>
        <table>
          <tr><th>Medicine</th><th>Codes</th><th>Adult dose</th><th>Frequency</th><th>Duration</th></tr>
          <tr><td>hydroxyurea po</td><td>B V</td><td>500mg</td><td>once a day</td><td>Indefinitely</td></tr>
        </table>
        <p><strong>Note:</strong> Use hydroxyurea 500 mgs daily indefinitely, titrate against HbF. Monitor white cell and platelets counts.<br /> Sickle cell trait requires no treatment, and does not cause anaemia.</p>
        <h3>G6PD deficiency</h3>
        <p>Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency is common in Zimbabwe. <strong> All patients should have a "Medic-alert" bracelet or necklace.</strong></p>
        <p>Severe anaemia occurs with intravascular haemolysis and haemoglobinuria on exposure to oxidant medicines (e.g. primaquine, dapsone, sulphonamides, quinolones, nitrofurantoin and in some cases quinine and chloroquine) and be worsened by acute infections e.g. malaria. Treat these episodes with intravenous fluids, oral iron and folate supplement; treat or remove the underlying cause.</p>
        <p>Prescribers must always check complete list.</p>
        <p><em>The risk of malaria outweighs the risk of haemolysis, so quinine should be used if indicated for malaria treatment unless the specific patient is known to sensitive to the specified anti-malaria in question.</em></p>
        <p><strong>Avoid blood transfusion unless clinically indicated. </strong></p>
        <h3>Other Anaemias</h3>
        <p><strong>HIV anaemia</strong> is a common finding with HIV and AIDS patients. Transfusion is only indicated in treating severe anaemia and cardiac failure. The causes of the anaemia include medicines such as zidovudine, and infections.</p>
        <p><strong>Other cytopaenias:</strong> refer to next section on Blood Products.<br />
          <strong>Aplastic anaemia</strong> presents as pancytopaenia. Diagnosis needs confirmation by bone marrow examination. Refer to central hospitals for specialist care after confirmation.<br />
          <strong>Myelodysplastic syndromes:</strong> refer to Central Hospital for specialist management.<br />
          <strong>Sideroblastic anaemia</strong> may occur in alcoholism, malignancy, hypothyroidism and particularly during TB treatment.  Some respond to vitamin B<sub>6</sub>, but refer to central hospital for specialist care.<br />
          <strong>Leukaemias:</strong> refer to central level.</p>
        <h3>Hereditary Bleeding Disorders</h3>
        <p><strong>Never</strong> use intramuscular injections and aspirin (paracetamol is safe). All patients should have a "Medic-alert" bracelet or necklace.</p>
        <p>Refer early for specialist management.</p>
        <p><em>All haemophiliac patients should be registered with the Haemophilia Association/Centre, Department of Haematology, P.O. Box A 178, Avondale, Harare. Clinics are held at Parirenyatwa Hospital every month.</em></p>
        <p>For haemarthrosis - do not aspirate joint. Treat by replacement of specific factor, joint support and analgesia e.g. paracetamol, codeine, morphine. Rest the joint during the acute period, give aprpropiate replacement factor and start physiotherapy as soon as the bleed resolves. <em>Some Haemophilia A and B patients are on a home therapy programme. They have written instructions on recommended dosage but may require assistance from health personnel. </em></p>
        <h4>Haemophilia A (factor VIII deficiency)</h4>
        <p>The amount of factor VIII given depends on assessment of severity of bleed. Use the table below to determine dosage, for both children and adults according to body weight.</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Ice compression should be applied as soon as possible, as this reduces the bleed.</li>
        </ul>

          </tbody>
          <small>
            Note: For 1 and 2 above, repeat the dose 12 hourly if bleeding persists or swelling is increasing. With more severe bleeds it is usually necessary to continue treatment with half of total daily dose 12 hourly for 2 -3 days, occasionally longer. <br />
            Note: For 3 and 4 above, treatment and surgery should be done <strong>with specialist supervision only</strong>. Measure levels, (if possible), otherwise give immediately before surgery. Continue 12 hourly therapy for 48 hours postoperatively and if no bleeding occurs, scale down gradually over next 3 -5 days.<br />
            Note: cryoprecipitate or of fresh frozen plasma should only be used in the absence of safe treated factor products.</small>
        </table>
        <ul>
          <li>As adjunct to factor replacement in mucosal or gastrointestinal bleeding and surgery, give fibrinolytic inhibitor [tranexamic acid]. Do not use for haematuria.</li>
          <li>If viral-inactivated treated Factor VIII is unavailable: see previous table for cryoprecipitate doses. </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Haemophilia B (factor IX deficiency)</h4>

        <p>Factor VIII concentrate and cryoprecipitate are not useful for Haemophilia B, so accurate diagnosis is essential.</p>
        <h5>von Willebrand Disease (vWD)</h5>
        <p>The currently available FVIII concentrate from the National Blood Transfusion Service contains vW factor (but always check the insert).</p>
        <p>Using this FVIII concentrate treat as for mild or moderate bleed of Haemophilia A. Repeat haemostatic dose every 24-48 hours since therapeutic response is more sustained in vWD.</p>

          Unfractinated heparin is given subcutaneously or intravenously. The dose is dependent on the activated partial thromboplastin time ratio (aPTTR). It has a short half-life and needs laboratory facilities. <br />
          Low molecular weight heparin is given subcutaneously with a fixed dose. No laboratory monitoring facilities are required.</p>
        <h3>Prophylaxis for Deep Vein Thrombosis (DVT)</h3>

          <li>Obesity</li>
          <li>Prolonged immobility</li>
          <li>Hereditary thrombophilia states (antithrombin III, factor V Leiden deficiency, protein C & S deficiency etc.)</li>
          <li>Paroxysmal nocturnal haemoglobinuria</li>
          <li>Previous history of DVT</li>
          <li>Various malignances</li>
          <li>Other pro-thrombotic states such as artificial cardiac valves and atrial fibrillation need lifelong anticoagulation. </li>

        <h2>Use of Blood amnand Blood Products</h2>
        <h3>General Principles</h3>
        <p>Efforts should be made to avoid transfusions wherever possible because of:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>The need to conserve scarce and expensive blood products.</li>
          <li>The risk of Transfusion Transmitted Infections e.g. HIV and Hepatitis C (window period) and other transmissible agents.</li>
          <li>The risk of transfusion reactions.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>There are limited and specific indications for transfusion. Use the appropriate blood fraction to treat specific defects. Transfuse patients during normal working hours: avoid night-time transfusion whenever possible.</p>
        <small>Note: Anaemia - The correct management of a patient with anaemia is to identify and treat the cause.  Blood transfusion is required only when the anaemia is life-threatening e.g. cardiac failure or when it prohibits other necessary treatment e.g. chemotherapy or surgery.  A slow rise of haemoglobin in response to haematinics is not an indication for transfusion.<br />
          Note: The routine use of frusemide is not necessary. When needed, e.g. in cardiac failure, give small doses (e.g. 20mg). Intra-venous frusemide is rarely required.<br />
          Blood must be kept at appropriate temperature as much as possible</small>
        <h3>Specific Indications for Use of Blood and Blood Products</h3>
        <h4>Red Cell Concentrate (Packed Cells)</h4>
        <h5>Medicine</h5>
        <p>Give packed cells in the following situations:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Acute major haemorrhage.</li>
          <li>Chronic anaemia-when patient has symptoms of cardiac failure due to low haemoglobin (less than 5g/dl);</li>
          <li>Anaemic patient (less than 5g/dl) due to have haemodialysis; (Elderly patients may require Hb levels higher than 8g/dL)Prior to, and following aggressive cytotoxic programmes, maintain haemoglobin at/or above 8g/dl;</li>
          <li>Low haemoglobin (less than 8g/dl) in presence of severe and persistent infections and septicaemia;</li>
          <li>Acute haemolysis where patient has symptoms of cardiac failure.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Paediatrics</h5>
        <p>Small packs (100mls) are available.  Indications are as for adults (see above list). Where transfusion is given on appropriate indication to children with protein-energy malnutrition, they should be transfused slowly (not more than 2.5 ml/kg body weight/hour).</p>
        <p>The presence of anaemia and safety of procedures must be evaluated on a patient to patient basis. There is no single safe haemoglobin level, patient haemodynamics must be evaluated against the procedure to be performed.</p>
        <p>Patients are generally haemodynamically stable at haemoglobin levels above 8 gm/dL for several procedures, but anticipation of blood loss must be assessed before each procedure.</p>
        <h4>Platelet Concentrates</h4>
        <p><strong><em>Note: this product is often used inappropriately</em><br />This section applies to all disciplines.</strong></p>
        <h5>Indications for Use of Platelet Concentrates</h5>

          <li>Operations with platelets less than 30 x 109/L</li>
          <li>Cranial operations and eye operations need platelets above 100 x 109/L).</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>No justification for use of platelets in:</h5>
        <ul>
          <li>Low platelet count in patient with no evidence of bleeding, [most transfused platelets will be eliminated within 24 hrs.</li>
          <li>Autoimmune thrombocytopenia.</li>
          <li>HIV thrombocytopenia without bleeding.</li>
