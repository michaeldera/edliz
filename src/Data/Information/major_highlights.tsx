            <h1>Major Highlights in the Latest EDLIZ</h1>
            <h2>Preamble</h2>
            <p>
                The major changes in this latest edition of EDLIZ will be highlighted here so that you are aware of
                recommendations that you need to consider in your medicine management or supply issues. Ideally each
                hospital should create its own local medicine formulary which shows which medicines are considered very
                useful in that setting so that you do not have to order medicines that your doctors will not prescribe
                or use. For instance you should not keep specialist medicines if there is no specialist to prescribe
                them. Hospital Medicine and Therapeutics Committees should select medicines for use in their hospital
                using the EDLIZ.

            <h2>New chapter</h2>
            <p>There is one new chapter – Overview of Surgical Conditions.</p>
            <h2>Antibiotics</h2>
            <p>
                A new cephalosporin, Cefixime, has been added to the treatment of sexually transmitted illnesses.
                Azithromycin has also been added to the treatment of gonococcus.
            </p>
            <h2>Immunisation</h2>
            <p>
                Rotavirus immunisation has now become routinely available. Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) vaccination is
                currently being used in a limited setting but it is hoped that it will be rolled out nationally in 2016.
            </p>
            <h2>Asthma Treatment</h2>
            <p>
                Given that salbutamol Inhalers are more accessible, <strong>oral</strong> salbutamol has been phased out
                completely. You will need to ensure that your patients are aware of this change. Use of steroids as an
                inhaler should be used in place of regular oral Salbutamol. Health care workers will need to check that
                their clients can use the inhalers appropriately.
            </p>
            <h2>ART Guidelines (use latest ART guidelines)</h2>
            <p>
                Stavudine containing regimens are being phased out and will not be available except for a limited number
                of patients who will still need them. For first line therapy, tenofovir/lamivudine and efavirenz will be
                used in most instances for adults, adolescents and children as well as pregnant women.
            </p>
            <p>
                Third line antiretroviral medicines will be available in selected hospitals. These third line medicines
                will include raltegravirraltegravir and darunavir. Please familiarise yourself with the dosing of these
                new medicines and the algorithm for their use.
